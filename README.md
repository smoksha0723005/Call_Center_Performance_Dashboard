## Comprehensive Performance Dashboard for Call Center Operations

### 1. Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a unified dashboard that provides a clear, real-time view of call center operations across various metrics and dimensions. This dashboard aims to facilitate quick decision-making by offering insights into agent performance, call volume distribution, and overall productivity within the call center.

## 2. Key Questions and KPIs:
Key Questions:
1. How does agent productivity correlate with the types of calls (inbound vs. outbound)?
2. What are the trends in call volumes over different months?
3. How do different managers impact the volume and effectiveness of calls handled?

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
1. Total number of calls (inbound and outbound)
2. Calls handled per manager
3. Average rating of agents across different processes
4. Productivity percentage
5. Monthly trend in call volume

## 3. Process:
The dashboard aggregates data from various sources within the call center's operational database. Data is processed and analyzed to present:

1. Total call counts by day and type (inbound/outbound).
2. A productivity gauge indicating the percentage of operational efficiency.
3. A breakdown of calls by manager to assess managerial impact on performance.
4. Visualization of calls versus productivity to find optimal performance benchmarks.

## 5. Insights:
1. The call volume shows a peak in November, suggesting a potential seasonal influence on call patterns.
2. Productivity is predominantly high at 82.7%, indicating effective call handling.
3. Shiva Reddy manages the highest number of calls, potentially highlighting effective team leadership or a higher team headcount.
4. The pie chart indicates a significantly higher number of outbound calls (68.52%), which could suggest a focus area for training or optimization.
5. Agents handling tech support from the USA show varying performance ratings, with a notable low rating for Kanoma Chetri, pinpointing possible areas for training.

## 6. Conclusion:
This dashboard effectively highlights key performance metrics and operational insights that are critical for managing a call center. It identifies strengths in productivity and areas needing attention, such as specific managerial strategies or agent training programs. Continual monitoring and analysis using this dashboard can drive improved operational efficiencies and enhanced agent performance.
